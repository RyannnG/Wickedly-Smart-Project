if you didn't about the game of life, just press "random" then "start" ,have fun :)

Here are the rules for each cell:
For each cell on the first round:

1.If a cell has fewer than two living adjacent neighbors then the cell dies, by under-population. If a cell dies, don’t mark it on the second sheet.

2.If a cell has two or three live neighbors, it lives on to the next generation, so mark it on the second sheet.

3.If a live cell has more than three live neighbors, it dies because of overcrowding, so don’t mark it on the second sheet.

4.Finally, if any dead cell has exactly three live neighbors, it becomes a live cell by reproduction, so mark it as live on the second sheet.
